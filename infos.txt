How do you feel about figuring out a really scary beast of a retro console music file?

You are invited to use the VM we prepared for you, which contains a player and the song file.

We cloned game-music-emu from git@bitbucket.org:mpyne/game-music-emu.git, commit 2cbb70f3c27412db7e54ca65fa1a3fac3f6a7d64 to build libgme and gme_player.

If you have an x86_64 Arch Linux, Ubuntu 16.10 or Debian 8.6 desktop, maybe it's enough for you to use these bundled libraries, without downloading the full VM. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. If it crashes while playing play_me.spc, something is wrong and you should use our VM.
